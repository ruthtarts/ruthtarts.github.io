        <h4>Visual Hierarchy</h4>

          Visual hierarchy is a key principle students
            need to learn for creating effective, well-designed
            websites. Design in general is a form of communicating
            information, and visual hierarchy helps the viewer
            decipher which information is most important. The World
            Market website is a good example of good visual hierarchy. 
            The large sale ad in the middle of the page is both 
            bold in size and color, drawing our eye to it first. Since
            this is a sale that ends soon, they wanted to make sure everyone 
            who visits the website doesn't miss it. Below that image is a 
            menu with photos of new arrivals and fresh picks. And lastly, the
            red menu of My Offers at the bottom commands the least attention.

        <h4>Rule of Thirds</h4>

      <p>
        The Rule of Thirds is a helpful design tool to help you place elements where they should go. You can place a real or imaginary grid over your design so that it is divided equally into thirds both vertically and horizontally.
        The points in the grid that intersect is where you should place details that will break up the design and make it more interesting. This Barnes & Noble front page shows a good use of the rule of thirds. If you were to
        lay a grid on top, the focal points (the books) would match up with the points in the grid. This layout is morer appealing than if everything were aligned in the center.

        <h4>White Space and Clean Design</h4>

        <p>
          White space and clean design are very popular in modern web design, and for good reason. Not only does this type of design look better, it is also more readable and easier to navigate. Not all "white space" is actually white,
          but can be just blank space that isn't filled up with color or text. Pottery Barn Teen uses white space and clean design on their mobile site. It is simple and uncluttered, with the menus and search bars easy to locate.
          The colors don't compete with each other, but compliment the airy feel of the design.
