      <h4>Target Audience</h4>
      <p>
        Our target audience of this website are adult citizens of Preston, Soda Springs, and surrounding communities. From those with families, business owners, or organizers of community events, our audience wants to be in the know of 
        the happenings in their locality. Something that our audience is lacking is a centralized hub where they can find everything related to their region, including the weather, news, events, announcements, and 
        related articles and columns. By desktop, laptop, or mobile device, this website should give them easy access to everything they need to know about what is going on today in their community.

      <h4>Personas</h4>
      <h5>Ben</h5>
      <p>Ben is a mid-30's male living in the heart of Preston. He is married with 5 children under the age of 12. He has a bachelor's degree and is a business professional that works in finance at the local bank. 
        Ben enjoys spending his time hiking and riding ATV's, as well as attending events with his family. Some main uses of technology are the use of social media and networking
        within the community. Some goals Ben would have for the website include checking on the weather for his outdoor adventures, and a convenient community calendar to help him know what events to take his family to
        or would be good for networking.

       <h5>Leslie</h5>
      <p>Leslie is a 50 year old female living several miles away from Preston in a rural area called Thatcher. She is single with a masters degree, and has been a high school teacher at Preston High School for the past
        25 years. Leslie is also a track coach at the high school. In her free time she enjoys gardening, traveling, and going to restaurants. She doesn't use technology very often, but uses her phone to text and send
        photos. Some goals Leslie would have for the website would include checking the weather to plan the track activities as a coach. She would also use it to find deals at local restaurants. Websites that are 
        simple and accessible are important to her.
